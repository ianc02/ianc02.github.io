                    I spent my 2022 summer at the University of Kansas REU (Research Experience of Undergraduates) program in Lawrence. I had applied to a few different REU's 
                    (Madison made me, and I'm glad she did) and was accepted to both KU and Kansas State. I opted for KU and did some incredible research. I was very lucky to be 
                    placed with the Thompson group, an incredibly smart, inclusive, and caring group, with Ashley Borkowski as my mentor. When I arrived at KU, I had never touched 
                    computational chemistry, and had only done a semester of thermodynamics. A lot of Ashleys research at the time was focused on water movement in Molecular Dynamics 
                    Simulations (MDS) while my background was more biochemistry focused. Her and Dr. Thompson were able to find a great bridge between our interests and we started 
                    working on how osmolytes effect water dynamics. Out of the ten week program, the first two weeks was just reading and research. Learning everything I could about 
                    these dynamical systems and papers with many differing theories as to why these phenomena take place. It was a lot. Over the next eight weeks though I was able to 
                    simulate interactions between the osmolytes and water and gather structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical data into a consice and (relativley) finished project that 
                    I presented on at the 2023 national ACS meeting as well as helped with data curation for a paper published (link here).

                            <p>Disco Tray Studios is an organization started by Professor Mark Goadrich at Hendrix College as a way of employeeing students as a way to gain professional experience and provide free software development to local companies. I worked in the game development side creating educational games to help develop learning in an interactive and engaging way.

On my site you can find the projects I worked on and the (usually) weekly blog we would keep up with regarding progress!</p>

                            <p>I did an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) at the University of Kansas the summer of 2022. There, I worked under the supervision of Professor Ward Thompson and Dr. Ashely Borkowski developing molecular dynamics simulations of trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO) and urea in water.</p>

                            <p>In my second to last semester of college as a part of the computer science program, we were tasked with a semester long project that would push us as developers. I had been wanting to grow my skills as a game developer in several facets but could never find the time to do so. This project allowed for that time and, although it is still far from complete, the overall game is up and running and available for download.</p>
