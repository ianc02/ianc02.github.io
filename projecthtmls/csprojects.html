                                This project was my COVID baby. After we all got kicked off campus in March of 2020, we were given our final project assignment in my 
                                introductory computer science course. I was stuck in the house all day and poured so much time into this project. I was getting into 
                                <a href="https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/" target="_blank">A Dark Room</a> again (if you haven't played it I cannot recommend it enough. 
                                It's on mobile too!) and decided I wanted to do something similar for my project. The premise of the game, if you're unfamiliar, is that the player 
                                explores a top-down ASCII world gathering resources and growing their strength to explore more while unraveling an underlying storyline. I tried to 
                                incorporate a lot of that into mine. If you'd like to give it a try, you can <a href="https://github.com/ianc02/FinalProjectCSCI150" target="_blank">download the files here!</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since at this point, I had about four months of coding experience and it all in Python, my options were limited. I started by designing a map for 
                                the player to explore and then using print() statements to load in the world at each step. It looks janky, but it worked enough! Getting interactions 
                                between the player and the world wasn't difficult since everything is stored in a 2D array, I could just check player position against the map and 
                                all player input was text-based. The most-confusing part was battles between the player and enemies. I wanted to have it more like A Dark Room with 
                                options and buttons for the player to press but I remember that interfering with player movement and I couldn't figure it out, so I ended up just having 
                                an auto-battler.

                                The next semester, I was in a data management course that utilized python to visualize and manipulate data in different ways using libraries like Pandas, Mesa, and NumPy. 
                                If you've ever had the pleasure of looking for online local data libraries to use, its not easy to find interesting ones. That being said, I got some cool data. My partner on 
                                the project and I came across lobster migration data. The data stated that mean lobster location is moving north (about 4.3 miles a year) due to increase in ocean waters, which is causing 
                                problems for fishermen in Maine as they get closer to Canadian waters and lose jurisdiction. We used Monte-Carlo simulations, choropleths, and agent-based modeling to predict 
                                when lobsters may move too far away to be realistically fished. This was a great project to me because it was the first time I had to incorporate a lot of techniques that I 
                                had been learning all semester. <a href="https://github.com/ianc02/LobsterFinal" target="_blank">Here are some of the files</a>, but more should be up soon!

                            <p>
                                In my data structures course, we were learning Java and our first project was coming up. We were still online due to COVID so I had a lot of time to spend towards this. 
                                We needed to do something with a 2D array I believe, and for some reason Minesweeper was what I wanted to make. So the first step in making a minesweeper game, as it turns out, 
                                is knowing how to play minesweeper. First I learned how to play minesweeper (This was a mistake, I have a debilitating addiction to it that survives to this day). Then I got 
                                started on creating the board. This was a ton of fun as I had accidentally started using recursion without even realizing it. When a player selects a cell, if there are no bombs 
                                around it then it also opens up every cell around it. Additionally, every cell that is opened that also does not have a neighboring bomb does the same, and the method I made did 
                                the same. This is super obvious but at the time it blew my shit away how a core concept of the game can be coded so easily. Beyond that, the game is pretty simple and to be honest, 
                                not good. I plan on making a web-version as well at some point and some things to improve upon is instead of creating the map when the game starts, I need to create it on players 
                                first selection to make sure that they don't get a bomb on their first click, much like the Google version. The GUI version was a bit better since it kept track of how many flags 
                                should be placed, had a time, and players could just click instead of type in coordinates! Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ianc02/Minesweeper" target="_blank">download the files here!</a>
