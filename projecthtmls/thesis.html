                            <p>Disco Tray Studios is an organization started by Professor Mark Goadrich at Hendrix College as a way of employeeing students as a way to gain professional experience and provide free software development to local companies. I worked in the game development side creating educational games to help develop learning in an interactive and engaging way. You can <a href="https://discotraystudios.github.io/" target="_blank">Click Here</a> to learn more about it. On my site you can find the projects I worked on and the (usually) weekly blog we would keep up with regarding progress!</p>

                            <p>I did an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) at the University of Kansas the summer of 2022. There, I worked under the supervision of Professor Ward Thompson and Dr. Ashely Borkowski developing molecular dynamics simulations of trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO) and urea in water.</p>

                            <p>In my second to last semester of college as a part of the computer science program, we were tasked with a semester long project that would push us as developers. I had been wanting to grow my skills as a game developer in several facets but could never find the time to do so. This project allowed for that time and, although it is still far from complete, the overall game is up and running and available for download.</p>
