                    Below you can find all the projects I worked on during my time at Disco Tray Studios. Descriptions for each are found along with links directly 
                    to the games (to the best of my knowledge).

                                <p class="project-description" style="display: block;">Cultivating Competencies was a great game to work on. We strayed from our usual platform of Unity 
                                    and instead opted to use the Ren'Py system. Ren'Py is great for visual novels, and has many built in features that we thought 
                                    would work great with our approach to a choice-based game. The purpose of the game is to give incoming freshman a quick peak 
                                    into their first couple years at college from the perspective of professional development. Players are meant to balance multiple 
                                    facets of their lives for the best overall outcome. This is accomplished by splitting the game into two segments thats repeated 
                                    (as of right now) five times; the player does a story-mode event where they make choices that effect their competencies. Once 
                                    they're done with that, they move on to a section where they have more freedom and get to pick several locations on campus to 
                                    new events. It was a ton of fun to work on, and we had great resources working with the Hendrix Career Center.

            '"My First Progress Post!"': 'This is my first official post on my site! I am still learning some basics of Jekyll and html so this will likely be a little boring looking for now. I am starting this as a part of the Disco Tray Studios that I was recently employed at,but I also plan on using it for personal projects and ways to track my progress over time.It will take me a bit before I can figure out how to like some of my projects to the site, so for now it will just be text blogs.I am going to keep a lot of the default jekyll code on the site for now to use asa reference as I learn how to fully utilize all the tools.',
            '"Update on Unity games"': 'The past couple weeks, Jonathon, Andrew, and I have been meeting up with past community partnersfrom CSCI-370 (Interactive Game Development) to get their feedback on the games that weredeveloped in partnership with them. From these meetings we got to understand better about what theyliked from the team that made them the game in the spring semester of 2021, what they would want changed,and what their new or original goals were for the game.We have decided we will start by working on Astronomical Bodies, Chem-Sim, and @itsmaya at first.These games were developed for the physics, chemistry, and sociology departments, respectively.Most of the work that I have put in has been into Astronomical bodies, which focuses on a simulation ofcelestial bodies in a 2D plane in space, while allowing the user to manipulate data so that the game isa sort of educational sandbox of a solar system. A lot of work has gone in to understanding the codefrom the group who originally worked on it, and once I got a more stable footing I began work on a tutorialfor the game as many notes about the game asked for features that were present, but not necessarily intuitive.I am mostly done with it, and plan on finishing it before our next Wednesday meeting on the 29th. After this, Iplan on working on figuring out an issue we found while looking through the code, which is that the valuesused in the game are \'magic numbers\' and are not real representations of what happens, which causes manyof the features that our partner, Dr. Ann Wright, impossible. We have two possible solutions that we will discuss morein our meeting though.I have also made a bit of progress in the Chem-Sim game, which focuses on users to create reactions by selectingdifferent molecules and being able to be quizzed on their enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy values. Most ofthe work that I have put into it so far has been commenting code since I was a part of the original team in the spring.I have not been working on @itsmaya, a decision based game that follows the life of Maya, a young black girl, as shetraverses through the public school system being indirectly impacted by players decisions as higher-ups in the school system.',
            '"Progress on Astronomical Bodies"': 'This past week, I have been working a lot on the Astronomical Bodies game. The majority of mywork has been focused on the tutorial of the game, including debugging and adding in new features,such as the in-time distance calculation between two bodies that Jonathon created. I have also had a largehand in implementing a new gravity system that uses Newtons gravitational interaction equation and the actualmasses of the planets. There are still sadly a few key features that we wanted to include that we have notbeen able to get yet, such as a real life value for distance or time it takes a body to orbit. One theorythat we have is that since we are using the right equation and masses, the distance is technically correct,since the in-game time is real time. Essentially, the game has the bodies at a distance that, with those massesand times to orbit, is accurate. We have a few ways of going about solving this, such as having a distance modifierso that calculations are correct. Another plan is to have a logarithmic scaling model. Either way, we hope tofinish with this within the next couple days. Being able to display time to orbit for a body isa problem that could have many complications. For example, do we do this on only planets, or stars as well?How would this work in a binary system? How do we decide which bodies are orbiting what? This is somethingwe think we will have to talk to Dr. Wright about and come up with a plan together on what we should do,and in the mean time work on other projects. The plan is to work on Chem-Sim more, but we must getinto contact with Dr. Scott in order to get more reactions before much more work can be made on that, sowe may start on @itsmaya while we wait.',
            '"Discussion of CSCI 340 Community Partners and More"': 'During this weekly meeting, we discussed our current three largest projects,what progress we have made on them, and what progress we hope to make this week.First, we discussed the meeting we had planned the next day with the communitypartners for CSCI 340. We went over the itenerary and what sort of questions wewould be asking them. The next day we had our meeting and it went well. I spoke toProfessor Holly Payne, who wants a more streamlined website that is easier for herand her husband for their farm. I also spoke to Dr. Ann Wright about the websiteshe wants for promotion and information for an event she plans on throwing forthe solar eclipse in 2024.The second thing we talked about were the itch.io account that we made forus to post games that we improve from last semesters Interactive Game Dev course,and the meetings that we have been setting up that will take place over the nextweek with the community partners from that class to get feedback on what theythought of the games.The last thing that was discussed was the Good Vibed app that is in development.We were shown a demonstration on what the app does, as well as share ideas onpossible tweaks to be made. We plan on having a demo available for Dr. Goadrich\'sTEC class by early october.Over the next week, I plan on playtesting the games made last semester so thatI am better prepared for the meetings that we will be having. From those meetingsand the critiques we get back, we will focus on getting the games to the what thepartners want.',
            '"Finishing up Astronomical Bodies"': 'Sadly we were not able to completely finish up the physics game last week, but we presentedin front of the group and they were able to give us a lot of ideas that are the focus point of this week.There are only a couple of major things to do, such as including actual distance and highlighting selected planets.Many of the new things we must work on are small, user interface things to just make the game feel a bitbetter. Once we wrap this up, Chem-Sim is going to be our new focus with adding more reactions, creatinga more user friendly interface, and boosting up some potential style issues. Astronomical bodies has beena much longer than expected project, but I believe it was still a good first choice since it showed us just howmuch work some of these games may need, despite how they looked on the surface level. We thoughtthis game was almost done from the start but we ended up having to rework the entire gravity system. I hopethat this learning experience will allow us to complete these next games in a more timely manner.',
            '"Astronomical Bodies uploaded to itch.io!"': 'We finished up the first major push of Astronomical Bodies and Jonathon got it onto Disco TrayStudios itch.io page! This will likely not be the last we work on this game, but the progresswe made was substantial and anything from here on out should be minor improvements. We are nowmoving on to focus much more on the Chem-Sim game, which is a sort of educational sandbox gamethat is supposed to teach users about enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Users are alsogoing to be able to insert molecules from a menu to have interact with one another in a higherdegree than what is currently available. Another major improvement is going to be making thegame more user friendly, both in terms of how the system works and visually, as there arecurrently many clashing aspects that make it hard to focus. Our first major goal will be tocreate a better system for molecule selection so that there can be little pictures of them alongwith their name and values. There is not much to report on, progress wise, this week since we aretransitioning between games and we just had fall-break, but now that we are back in businesshopefully we can make lots of progress and won\'t have to rework an entire game system again.[Here is the link for Astronomical Bodies!](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/astronomical-bodies)',
            '"Disco Tray Studios First Meeting!"': 'We had our first meeting at Disco Tray Studios! We got to know more about eachother and learn about everyone\'s strengths and what their focus will be in the team.I will be doing a lot of work focused on the Game Dev part of the group, althoughI am going to be learning more about front-end code so I can help out there too.Right now the largest priorities for Game Dev is reaching out to get feedback fromlast semesters community partners who worked with the InteractiveGame Development course, creating an itch.io page for Disco Tray Studios wherewe can post the games that that class had made and that we will help refine, andalso working on my own site so it looks a lot better.',
            '"First Progress Report On Chem-Sim!"': 'For the past week and a half, we have been putting a lot of our efforts into Chem-Sim.Jonathon has been doing a lot of fixing graphical issues and making the game look alot nicer, while most of my focus has been going towards creating a new table forselecting reactants instead of the scroll wheel that existed first. We were able tospeed up this process considerably by reusing the drag and drop cells from AstronomicalBodies, although I did have to tweak it a bit to better work for our case. Currently allthe reactants are in a 4x3 grid with non-interactable rotating gameobject representationsof the molecules for better clarity. Our plan is to have even more reactions possible withthe reactants we have now, and with more that we are supposed to get from our partner,Dr. Scott. This game seems to be moving a lot quicker than Astronomical Bodies, which isgreat news, although I do definitely see this game being one we go back to a lot to keepadding new molecules and updating features after publishing. I think a good goal for us isto get it uploaded onto itch.io by next Wednesday and be on our next game at that point.',
            '"Updates On Chem-Sim"': 'We have made a lot of progress on Chem-Sim and are already getting to a good pointto publish a first version onto our itch.io page. We decided to make a lot of visualchanges over this week such as changing the layout of everything to make it morespacious and have things less spread out. We have also been working on concisenessbetween scenes, molecules, and visual things such as button colors and shape.Over the past week, I have been mostly working on getting the our new reactantstable to work in the tutorial and on making the molecules look just a bit better.I believe Jonathon has been using this week to transition onto future projects suchas Climate Goes Political and @itsmaya in order to get a larger head start so thatwe can get both of those published and have good progress on our last two gamesbefore the semester is over. We are going to use this upcoming Wednesday to showcaseour progress on Chem-Sim to get any last minute critiques and suggestions before weupload and move on.',
            '"Two More Games Published!"': 'This was a very good week for the GameDev team at Disco Tray Studios! We wereable to finish builds on both Chem-Sim and Climate Goes Political and get themboth published onto itch.io. Chem-Sim is in early stages right now as we havenot got any new molecules to add, but we did change up a lot of the user interfaceas well as some of the behind the scenes aspects of the game. It is a busy time ofthe year for everyone, so it is difficult to find times to work together with ourcommunity partners for games, but we are able to get these preliminary visionsout so that they may give feedback on what we can do based off our meetingsearly in the semester!As for Climate Goes Political, there was not much more that Dr. Chomphosy wantedfrom the game as he was very happy where it was, and anything else to make it alevel above would have been way out of our current scope without committing alarge amount of time towards learning about online play and complex equationsused in economics. Jonathon was able to get a lot of consistency throughout thegame and everything is running a bit more smoothly and looking a bit better!At this point, I believe most of our focus is going to be going towards tryingto get @itsmaya completed or at least at a good level of completion that we canhave Dr. Veselka-Bush try it out and give a lot of feedback.[Chem-Sim on itch.io](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/chemsim)[Climate Goes Political on itch.io](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/climate-goes-political)',
            '"Starting on @itsmaya"': 'Since we published both Chem-Sim and Climate Goes Political on itch.io, on Wednesdaywe discussed what our plan was going to be for @itsmaya. We talked about how toimplement the new \'Capital\' system so that we could use the relationships ofdifferent groups of people (Teachers, Faculty, Parents, Students, and Community)in order to be able to obtain new policies. The idea is that each decision willhave some numerical value associated to it for each group and the players relationshipto those groups will be positively or negatively effected. Without a certain amountof support from certain groups, some things may not be possible as well. Our hopeof switching from a monetary system to this capital system is that it becomesmore apparent that money is not necessarily the root of modern problems, but thedecisions and their effects themselves that led to the problems. This week we areworking on getting the new capital system into the game and being able to movethe game forward with this new system, and then next week we will likely work onchanging up more of the issues and policies to better match what we want.In other news, Jonathon and I were able to sit in on a class with Dr. Chomphosyand his students as they played Climate Goes Political together in teams. It wasvery interesting to see how they were a bit unsure of the game and what directionit would go in comparison to what they learned in class about game theory, butafter a first initial game to understand how the game works, they caught on fastand every team managed to significantly better and even start to communicateamongst one another. It provided some valuable insight on how others would approachthis game and really helped us understand where we should take it in the nextupdate with ideas of clarification, helpful progression pieces, and randomization.',
            '"First Meeting of the Year"': 'We had our first meeting of the semester and year! It was nice to catch up anddouble check where we are and what our future plans were. We are presenting ourrough draft for @itsmaya tomorrow so that the team can throw suggestions andquestions our way for us to work on before we upload to itch.io and schedule ameeting with Dr. Veselka-Bush. A lot of what I have done is looking through thesources we were given and giving an in-game explanation of why certain decisionsare or are not good and what impact they have on students. We have not updatedthe entire game to match this, just the first half so we did not do a bunch ofunnecessary work in the event that Dr. Veselka-Bush wants to go in a differentdirection.I also sent messages out to our other partners that we have completed rough draftgames for, but they have not responded yet so I will try again tomorrow. Our next  game to work will depend on what responses we get back, how early we can meet withDr. Veselka-Bush, and how busy Jonathon will be with the new websites Disco TrayStudios is taking on.Speaking of the new websites, we also got a new team member now that Vi hasgraduated. Connor was in the database and web systems course, so he will beworking on the websites a lot. I believe these will be a major focus in the secondhalf of the semester as I think we are wanting to launch Good Vibes and slow downthe work on it.I am excited to see what all we will accomplish this semester and am lookingforward to working on all these great projects!',
            '"Thanksgiving and @itsmaya Progress"': 'Since the last update, we were able to get a good working capital system implementedinto @itsmaya. A player is able to use their relationships to different partiesto enact different policies and immediately see how their decisions effected everyone.Over the past couple weeks, progress has been slow going due to a combination ofThanksgiving break and finals approaching near. We have been able to get a starton a bit of everything though, such as balancing the capital system values whenenacting new policies and getting the UI system to be more intuitive, taking outunnecessary items from the original game, including new scenarios, and becomingmore familiar with the issues that we are trying to address. While it is difficultto find time to work on this now, once winter break starts we should have a lotmore free time to focus on this and our other games. We are  very closeto having a \'rough draft\' to publish so we can get some feedback, and that shouldhelp us out a lot in making good progress. ',
            '"Jumping Back In!"': 'Welcome back! This is my first post in a while since I have been taking a breaksince the last one. After last semester and finals, I needed one. Jumping backin though, I see a good future for us! Jonathon ended up doing some work throughoutwinter break which was fun to catch back up on. I have done some work on @itsmayamostly fixing progression issues, beginning a layout for explanations of outcomesto the users (although I am not sure if the current way it is set up will stay),and starting to include our sources into the game itself. Progress has been slow,a lot of which I will contribute to the confusing and almost maze-like backbone ofprogression code that the original game was built upon. Another part is there areseveral things I have noticed or wanted to bring up before implementing/changingand luckily we have our first meeting of the spring semester tomorrow where I cantalk to Jonathon about them. Disco Tray Studios is getting more clients this semester,but for websites instead of games. This will be exciting for the group, although Iknow almost nothing about websites so I am sure I am going to either be learning a lotin a short amount of time or I will be working more independently on the games. ',
            '"Final Push for @itsmaya!"': 'After a discussion on what else we should include and what we should alter inregards to @itsmaya, we have spent much of this week doing that. A lot of myfocus has been on aesthetics and flow, which are areas that I am usually not tooinvolved in. It has been a struggle this past week. The other day, after workingfor around 2 hours my computer crashed and I lost all progress and couldn\'t workuntil the next day. There is no easy way to do good looking borders on an imagein unity, so what I ended up doing is having to paint a border on a copy of thepolicy images and then alternate the two images in game, which took me a whilebecause I have never really created any art for one of our games and it took meseveral software to find a good one that was both intuitive and effective. I alsohad some trouble with the game that Jonathon did not have on his end, so I had tofigure those issues out and fix them. Luckily, reordering the first chapterwas extremely easy and only took about a fifth of the time I thought it would! Ihave learned a lot while working on this game, and I am going to miss the storywe were helping create, but after the struggle to get some things working I wouldbe lying if I said I was not also excited to move on and focus on something elsefor a bit. ',
            '"Learning Ren\'py"': 'Over the past week, I have been learning more about how to use Ren\'py. I was right,in that backgrounds have proven to cause quite a bit of trouble. We had high hopesand thought that we would be able to get a demo out in a week, but that did notwork out. Keeping persistent data and using it throughout has proven more difficultthan expected as there is a bit of a learning curve with it. The same goes withbackgrounds. There were a few novel ways of making some that I thought would workbetter for the game, but after not being able to make one for the competencies,just using images is probably the best way to go. In good news, I was able tomake an interactive map that advances the story! I got a lot of help from [this](https://zeillearnings.itch.io/map-navigation)creator who had made one. I got the map from the Hendrix website and afteradvancing my Krita skills, was able to make the map. We have also been working onwriting a story together and thinking about how the logistics of the game will work.I am hoping that working in-person together will help us figure out how to fixthe issues we are having faster so we can get the game out to career services.  ',
            '"Welcome back!"': 'Disco Tray Studios is back after summer! We are picking up right where we left offwith working on Career Competencies, but with some additional tools and ideas. Atthe beginning of August Dr. Goadrich, Jonathon, and I went to Madison, Wisconsinto speak at the Play Make Learn event hosted at their university. It was anincredible experience where we were able to learn a lot from people with a ton ofexperience developing educational games. I am still sifting through all the notesbut once I get a more comprehensive list I can make a blog post dedicated to the visit.For now, we will be working on Career Competencies up until the end of Septemberwhen the two-year version is going to be used in explorations classes around campusso that we can get a ton of feedback and see how well students respond to this sortof approach. From there, we will decide which way to best move forward, and potentiallystart working on some other projects such as a game for the Windgate Museum. ',
            '"What\'s Next?"': '@itsmaya has been officially published to itch.io! It is looking great and itmakes me so happy to finally see it up there. Now that we have finished with thatfor now, we started discussing about what our next moves will be. We talked aboutwhether to continue on with either Art-tastrophe or the Career Services game. Idon\'t believe we made a concrete decision yet, but we are getting prepared foreither direction. I sent a message to the Director of the Windgate Museum of Art,Mary Kennedy, to ask about her ideas on the game and to set up a meeting time. Ihave not got a response back yet, but I am hopeful that we will continue work on it.For Career Services, Dr. Goadrich introduced us to an awesome Python engine forcreating interactive narratives called Ren\'py, which has been used to make gameslike Doki Doki Literature Club and A Letter of Challenge. I have been watchingintroductory videos in order to learn the system and get used to it, and amalready amazed with how much progress I made in a short amount of time. Thepre-built menu system saved a ton of time, and not having to mess with a canvasin Unity takes a lot of manual work away. I can already easily make dialogue,change backgrounds, create alternate endings, and perform a bunch of smallcustomizations that help make the game feel a bit more natural. At this point, Ithink that creating some UI elements such as characters or specific backgroundswill be the most challenging part, as user interaction seems pretty intuitive andI believe Ren\'py allows a lot more than simple click boxes, with a bit of manipulation.I am excited to try something new, and branch out a bit further in game developmentthan just Unity!',
            '"First Demo Sent Out"': '    We were able to push back out deadline to Wednesday, luckily. Connor, Jonathon, andI all finished our goals and were able to publish the game for a demo. All the membersof Disco Tray Studios played it and sent out a form for us with questions and comments.It was fun to watch their directions and helped us understand how we should better balanceour values. Unfortunately, there were a lot of times that the game seemed to crash.I believe most of the issues were minor bugs that we fixed in a few minutes before weuploaded a more stable version. We sent it to Career Services and they and theirstudent workers have tried it. During our meeting today we are going discuss whatpeople thought of the game, what issues need to be tackled, and when we are goingto meet with Career Services so that we can better discuss what needs to be done.This is our last week working on it before it needs to be completely finished for ourtwo year demo to send out to the explorations classes.',
            '"Completing the Career Services Game"': '    from our demo, we got some really great feedback! Unfortunately, we also gotnews that the structure of Career Services explorations class visits was changing,which meant so had the direction of the game. Luckily, we were still able to use itin Professor Seme\'s explorations class so we can still gather data from users. Thispast week has mostly consisted of finishing up writing some of the smaller map scenes,making the game feel more alive, and adding in some small ideas or plans suggested byour playtesters. I believe that the class is playing the game on Thursday, so we shouldhave more responses to our questionnaire for next Monday\'s meeting. I am not surewhat the future of the game will look like after this though.    In other news, the meeting for Mobile dev\'s community partners is tomorrow. Wewill be figuring out what everyone want\'s from their app, and we are there to helpprovide feedback and to keep things as realistic as possible. I know nothing aboutmobile development so I\'m sure it will be just as much of a learning experience forme as it will be for them!',
            '"Late Update"': 'Disco Tray Studios is back after summer! We are picking up right where we left offwith working on Career Competencies, but with some additional tools and ideas. Atthe beginning of August Dr. Goadrich, Jonathon, and I went to Madison, Wisconsinto speak at the Play Make Learn event hosted at their university. It was anincredible experience where we were able to learn a lot from people with a ton ofexperience developing educational games. I am still sifting through all the notesbut once I get a more comprehensive list I can make a blog post dedicated to the visit.For now, we will be working on Career Competencies up until the end of Septemberwhen the two-year version is going to be used in explorations classes around campusso that we can get a ton of feedback and see how well students respond to this sortof approach. From there, we will decide which way to best move forward, and potentiallystart working on some other projects such as a game for the Windgate Museum.So right after our first couple meetings, I ended up getting COVID and being out for two weeks.This threw us off a bit as it made working together more difficult but we are finally gettingcaught back up and although we are a tad behind, we are close to getting our demo out! As faras updates go, Connor joined with us since he had Renpy experience. We have split the workinto three main sections, with Connor writing another scene for us and implementing it in.Jonathon has been working to get our exhaustion system working and implemented throughoutthe entire game, so that a player cannot just choose every \'good\' option and easily getthe best ending easily. I have been working on our ending and creating pre=requisitesin order to get the job that the player wants.    How this works is that on every map scene, if the player goes to Career Servicesand asks for help on what to do next, they give the usual IRL advice, but then abonus scene pops up. Right now I have five of these implemented, but still needanother once Connor is done with his scene is pushes it. With these 5 current scenes,the player has opportunities to gain two experience points in either STEM, SocialSciences, or a more Business oriented path. At the end of the game, they mustchoose between one of these paths for a potential job and if they have enoughqualifications, then they get in. Otherwise they don\'t. I have implemented all scenes butif they get into a job. Once I do that I will be done with the ending entirely. There aremultiple ways to get a job, so that we still have the branching options.    That is the largest change I have made. Other, smaller ones include changing valuesfor competencies so that changes are more noticeable, animating the difference so theplayer can see how much they have lost or gained, and creating new expressions for othercharacters.    As I said earlier, we were supposed to have everything done by today for a demo wecould send Career Services. I am not quite ready for that unfortunately. I am going totry and extend the deadline into tomorrow or Wednesday, so that I can finish the finalscene quickly and have time to polish everything and check for bugs or issues thatlikely exist.',
            '"Managing Ren\'py"': 'At first, I thought this project would be simple and easy because of how simple Ren\'pywas to use. As it turns out, that simplicity is part of why it is so difficult. Itcan be very picky about certain things are used and it has been the case multipletimes that I would get an idea to do something, scour the internet, and find a \'solution\'that is from outdated documentation and no longer works, and it does not give any hintsas to what may be wrong. Due to this, most of my time has been to learning how to domore specific tasks in Ren\'py, and then debugging what I wrote. It is becomingmore natural to write in the language though, and I am finding myself not having tolook up things as often. I don\'t wish to jinx myself again, but I believe we arealmost finished with the demo. I have been able to separate our story sections out the waywe wanted with the map, added a section about career services, and included a way to keep trackof the cultural competencies earned along the way. I believe the only thing to doleft is incorporate the remaining half of the first year story into the game.',
            '"Moving On to Other Projects"': '  We are officially done with the demo of Career Competencies! Our final push wentout the other day and on Thursday, we had Professor Seme\'s explorations class play it.I, unfortunately, could not be there but from what I have read in the responses itseems like it went well, although I am sure I will get the full rundown of how itwent on Monday\'s meeting. Now that we have wrapped that up though, and there is nopressing deadline, we have been talking about what we will be working on in the future.  Our top three ideas right now are: working on the Windgate Museum art game that wehave been in talks with Lindsey Knight about; continuing work on @itsmaya and findinga new client to take on the project, or begin looking into how we may host the GameJamwe were planning on doing next semester. After some conversation, I believe Connorwill be leaving the game dev group for now, and Jonathon and I are both very dialoguedout so we were leaning more towards the art game. We set up a meeting with Lindsey andwill be recapping our original ideas and seeing where else this game may move towards,and this is happening Wednesday. Right now we are in a bit of a limbo of not muchwork to do, but I am excited to see what comes out of this.',
            '"Working on the Windgate Game"': '  We have been hard at work with the game. Right now, our focus is on \'repairing\'the artwork after someone has come in and sabotaged the pieces. This is done inseveral ways, like jigsaw puzzles, tile slides, ISpy, and other game types. This isa simpler approach to our original idea but I think it will work out well, especiallywith Lindsey wanting these to be on the Ipads in the Museum. Speaking of, I have beenable to play the puzzle game on my phone using Unity\'s remote testing app. It wasa bit slow, but I think that was mainly due to receiving input from the computer,changing things on the phone, then sending data back to the computer. Hopefullyeverything happens in real time with the actual app. I have on more game tocode in before we start moving onto a larger focus of aesthetics.',
            '"Continuing work with Windgate"': '  We have decided to work on the Windgate\'s game. We set up an initial meeting with Lindsey Knight, and have got some beginning ideas we are still throwing around, alongwith an initial game with a moveable character. I have not done much more work onthis game, as we had fall break and then I missed the two days after for a wedding.During today\'s meeting, I expect I\'ll get caught up with what Jonathon has been working onand we\'ll discuss our ideas along with Lindsey\'s input.',
            '"Moving Forward with the Demo"': 'Hello! It has been a while since my last blog post. After taking a mental healthbreak and then accidently forgetting to update the next week, I am back! Sincethe last post, we have finished up the demo of the game. Right now it has twochapters and showcases pretty much all of our plans besides storytelling andchoice-picking. A lot of UI updates were done including some better positioningof objects, easier readability, and some small animations. We have contactedCareer Services and are awaiting a response so that we can meet with them anddiscuss how to move forward with this project. ',
            '"Wrapping Up Windgate Demo"': '  I apologize for the late update, but we have been hard at work and are wrappingup our initial demo. We have five working games now, with the player being able tochoose what game they would like to play. We are trying to figure out how to makean app out of it and while we have it built for IOS, I think our initial planis to have it as a testflight app. We are trying to get in touch with Lindsey Knightso she can approve our demo and see if we want to take it any further.  In other news, Career Services wants to use their game again for career fair forsophomores in January. This will have around 130 new players so we are very excitedfor that, although there are a few changes we are going to have to make before it isready to go. Nothing major, just some quick tweaks to help some common sources ofconfusion. ',
            '"One Last Semester!"': '  We came back this semester ready to pick up right where we left off. We did somegreat planning to map out how this semester would go and decided that our firstpriority would be to finish the analytics for Career Competencies and that iswhat we have been working on for the past several weeks. This has been a lot oftrial and error. Through the process we made some good discoveries like how tohave a browser version of the game work in itch.io or how to get analytics tosend to Google Analytics 4 (Yay!), but of course there have been horrible issuesthat we are still stuck on now. Right now, analytics only works on downloadedversions of the game, not on web versions. This is due to an error "SSL Supportnot available". One potential fix for this is to host a proxy server that wouldaccept the requests from the game, and include SSL support before sending itoff to GA4 but I have no idea how to go about doing that. Another issue is thatgetting verification for downloadable versions of the game so that downloadingthe game is easier is either expensive or a long process I still have notmanaged to get to the end of. Right now, the game does include analytics and canbe downloaded, though it would be nice to have everything be easier for the users.  After working on analytics, we\'ll be moving on to Tempest Winds again, potentiallywith a mixup in whose working on it. Jonathon may move on to working on a coupleapps that came in from last semesters class, and Olivia and Matthew may start game devagain. Our goal is to have the game fully finished by the end of the semester, whichwill include about 3x the current number of games and a small story to connect thedifferent areas.',
            '"Finishing the Demo"': 'After spring break, we are jumping back in where we left off! I have been workingon our \'Hendrix Today\' cutscene in the game so that players will be aware of eventsgoing on at different locations of the campus at different points. This took a whileto finally get down since instead of using a bunch of if-statements in order toknow what to display, I wanted to have entries in a list that we could loop through.As I found out, for loops are not really supported in Ren.py, so it was a lot of trialand error. I did eventually figure out that they are supported when in reference toa screen, so once I was able to get that worked out I was able to debug the issues,and now we have information displayed after the player checks their resume afterevery chapter! I also included a section for Resume Tips, similar to the onesCareer Services provide in the real life Hendrix Today emails, along with a good vibefrom the app at the end. Other than that, I cleaned a lot of stuff and made thingsa lot more consistent and clean looking, as well as adding another area to the map.Right now, I am in the process of coding in the events displayed in Hendrix Today sothat we can have a fully functional demo of the first year for when we showcase ourgame tomorrow to Career Services and get to hear their feedback! ',
            '"Tempest Winds Update"': '  Sorry for the long delay in an update, but progress for Tempest Winds is goingreally well! We\'ve fleshed out everything we need to do to get a "complete" game,but I\'m sure it will continue to change, as it has already. I\'ve been focusingprimarily on mechanisms of gameplay, such as working on the games, making sure therearen\'t any issues with them, the interactions with the world, randomization on whodid the crime and setting up clues for that. I\'ve worked a bit on lighting and Ithink its about as good as its going to get before we start adding shaders and/orpost processing. Right now, the gameplay is almost complete. You can play and finish puzzles,and move on to the next level, but there is no story binding it all together. That is where a lot of my next focus is going to go into with character dialogue, art,and sound effects. This will include not only exposition but clues as well once theplayer completes enough puzzles. I\'m excited on the progress being made and can\'twait to polish this off into a finished product.',
            '"Meeting with Career Services"': 'Last Thursday we had our meeting with career services over the progress we hadmade on the game so far, and it went really well! They were a huge fan of the assets,the current story, and gameplay as a whole. After walking them through the game wetalked for a while about minor adjustments and things to include, along with somepotential story points to bring up. It was extremely helpful to hear their insightand get ideas about what else to include in the game. We were at a good point in thegame when we went to the meeting, foundation-wise, but now I think we\'ve been setback a bit. This is in a good way though, as there are a lot of great new things Iwould like to implement that would make the game a bit more intuitive and easieron the players, so the structure of the game will likely have to shift a bit. I haveso far started to incorporate some ideas, like including phone distribution builds(which is not going great, but that is why we start early!) and creating a tutorialfor the general concept of the game and how to navigate ren\'py in a helpful manner.I am excited for our Wednesday meeting because there is a lot we have to talk aboutand discuss as a team on where we take our game and what our main focus is going tobe moving forward. As a dream goal, I wanted to get the game into a rough beta versionwith all four years playable but after our meeting progressed and especially reflectingon it after the fact with all the changes we are thinking of implementing, I believeat a minimum we are going to try and get a good version of the game with the first 2 yearsplayable before summer.',
            '"Moving on to Tempest Winds"': '  After some trouble with getting analytics to work on a web version of CareerCompetencies, we decided to table that issue until later, and move on to TempestWinds for the Windgate Museum of Art. We had a great discussion on the future ofthe game and decided on expanding to three areas, with 4-5 games in each area. There isan overlying story as well, in which the player is an art restorationist who getsa call from a friend about how someone broke into their apartment and ruined theirpaintings. The player goes there and fixes the paintings, collecting clues onthe person who destroyed the paintings. They then head to a local professors officewho had the same issue, and the player can gather more clues there. Finally, they headto the local art museum for one more round of clue gathering by fixing paintingsand in the end, the player must use the clues to determine who destroyed the paintngs:the friend, the professor, or the curator of the museum. We are going to make itrandomly pick at the beginning of each game so it can be any one of them for somereplayability. Right now, we are in the process of making the new games and hiring an artist,and once we are finished with that, we are moving on to creating the new areas,working on dialogue, and inserting clues into the game. I\'m excited to watch thisgame grow and continue development on it!',
            '"Second Demo Sent Out"': 'We managed to finish and send out the second demo to career services! It took a bitlonger than expected, but we managed to get quite a bit into this new version and wehave already got feedback on it! I believe that the most notable changes are the addedstory which includes most of Sophomore year, some distinct UI changes that have backgrounddata controlling their view, and the tutorial. I did not manage to get quite as muchin story-wise, as we are still missing distinct parts of the end of Sophomore year,with things like research opportunities and more dialogue, but I included in the demoexplanations of where everything goes and how it will interconnect to past decisions,so that Career Services and their play-testers will understand where we are moving withthis. This week has been extremely difficult with trying to find time to work on thegame sadly, as finals are coming up and all my classes are doing their best to makethis week as busy as possible. I am going to try and work on this where possible,but I know progress will be slower than usual this next week. My goal is that by mylast final, I want to get Sophomore year completely finished, and tie up any more loosethreads, along with implement more UI such as new backgrounds and more characters.',
            '"Working on Updating the Demo"': 'This week, like last, has been painfully slow and also difficult to find time for.I have been incredibly busy with school, and also my computer has been having issuesleft and right and has been incredibly slow, so progress has not been as much asI had wanted. It has been a bit better so, although I wanted to get a second demoto Career Services today and I don\'t think that will happen, we are close and shouldbe able to get it tomorrow. So far, I have done a lot of structural changes in thegame to make it more like the end product and have included several new featureslike a small character creator where the player can enter in some necessary informationfor the game to know what to display sometimes, background variables to keep trackof competency values and a displayable that shows up on the resume to show that progressto the player, added a tutorial, and added in the a scene from the year 2 storyline.Right now, most of what we need to still complete for a demo is to include moreof the story, mostly for the second year, and add a bit more to the first yearso it feels more fleshed out.'
