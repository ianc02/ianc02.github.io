At first, I thought this project would be simple and easy because of how simple Ren'py
was to use. As it turns out, that simplicity is part of why it is so difficult. It
can be very picky about certain things are used and it has been the case multiple
times that I would get an idea to do something, scour the internet, and find a 'solution'
that is from outdated documentation and no longer works, and it does not give any hints
as to what may be wrong. Due to this, most of my time has been to learning how to do
more specific tasks in Ren'py, and then debugging what I wrote. It is becoming
more natural to write in the language though, and I am finding myself not having to
look up things as often. I don't wish to jinx myself again, but I believe we are
almost finished with the demo. I have been able to separate our story sections out the way
we wanted with the map, added a section about career services, and included a way to keep track
of the cultural competencies earned along the way. I believe the only thing to do
left is incorporate the remaining half of the first year story into the game.
