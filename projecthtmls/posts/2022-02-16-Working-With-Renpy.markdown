Over the past week, I have been learning more about how to use Ren'py. I was right,
in that backgrounds have proven to cause quite a bit of trouble. We had high hopes
and thought that we would be able to get a demo out in a week, but that did not
work out. Keeping persistent data and using it throughout has proven more difficult
than expected as there is a bit of a learning curve with it. The same goes with
backgrounds. There were a few novel ways of making some that I thought would work
better for the game, but after not being able to make one for the competencies,
just using images is probably the best way to go. In good news, I was able to
make an interactive map that advances the story! I got a lot of help from [this](https://zeillearnings.itch.io/map-navigation)
creator who had made one. I got the map from the Hendrix website and after
advancing my Krita skills, was able to make the map. We have also been working on
writing a story together and thinking about how the logistics of the game will work.
I am hoping that working in-person together will help us figure out how to fix
the issues we are having faster so we can get the game out to career services.
