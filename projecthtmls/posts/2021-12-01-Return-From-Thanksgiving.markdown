Since the last update, we were able to get a good working capital system implemented
into @itsmaya. A player is able to use their relationships to different parties
to enact different policies and immediately see how their decisions effected everyone.
Over the past couple weeks, progress has been slow going due to a combination of
Thanksgiving break and finals approaching near. We have been able to get a start
on a bit of everything though, such as balancing the capital system values when
enacting new policies and getting the UI system to be more intuitive, taking out
unnecessary items from the original game, including new scenarios, and becoming
more familiar with the issues that we are trying to address. While it is difficult
to find time to work on this now, once winter break starts we should have a lot
more free time to focus on this and our other games. We are  very close
to having a 'rough draft' to publish so we can get some feedback, and that should
help us out a lot in making good progress.
