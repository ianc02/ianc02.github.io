  Sorry for the long delay in an update, but progress for Tempest Winds is going
really well! We've fleshed out everything we need to do to get a "complete" game,
but I'm sure it will continue to change, as it has already. I've been focusing
primarily on mechanisms of gameplay, such as working on the games, making sure there
aren't any issues with them, the interactions with the world, randomization on who
did the crime and setting up clues for that. I've worked a bit on lighting and I
think its about as good as its going to get before we start adding shaders and/or
post processing. Right now, the gameplay is almost complete. You can play and finish puzzles,
and move on to the next level, but there is no story binding it all together. That 
is where a lot of my next focus is going to go into with character dialogue, art,
and sound effects. This will include not only exposition but clues as well once the
player completes enough puzzles. I'm excited on the progress being made and can't
wait to polish this off into a finished product.
