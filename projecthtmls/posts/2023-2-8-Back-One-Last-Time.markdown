  We came back this semester ready to pick up right where we left off. We did some
great planning to map out how this semester would go and decided that our first
priority would be to finish the analytics for Career Competencies and that is
what we have been working on for the past several weeks. This has been a lot of
trial and error. Through the process we made some good discoveries like how to
have a browser version of the game work in itch.io or how to get analytics to
send to Google Analytics 4 (Yay!), but of course there have been horrible issues
that we are still stuck on now. Right now, analytics only works on downloaded
versions of the game, not on web versions. This is due to an error "SSL Support
not available". One potential fix for this is to host a proxy server that would
accept the requests from the game, and include SSL support before sending it
off to GA4 but I have no idea how to go about doing that. Another issue is that
getting verification for downloadable versions of the game so that downloading
the game is easier is either expensive or a long process I still have not
managed to get to the end of. Right now, the game does include analytics and can
be downloaded, though it would be nice to have everything be easier for the users.
  After working on analytics, we'll be moving on to Tempest Winds again, potentially
with a mixup in whose working on it. Jonathon may move on to working on a couple
apps that came in from last semesters class, and Olivia and Matthew may start game dev
again. Our goal is to have the game fully finished by the end of the semester, which
will include about 3x the current number of games and a small story to connect the
different areas.
