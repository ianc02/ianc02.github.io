  After some trouble with getting analytics to work on a web version of Career
Competencies, we decided to table that issue until later, and move on to Tempest
Winds for the Windgate Museum of Art. We had a great discussion on the future of
the game and decided on expanding to three areas, with 4-5 games in each area. There is
an overlying story as well, in which the player is an art restorationist who gets
a call from a friend about how someone broke into their apartment and ruined their
paintings. The player goes there and fixes the paintings, collecting clues on
the person who destroyed the paintings. They then head to a local professors office
who had the same issue, and the player can gather more clues there. Finally, they head
to the local art museum for one more round of clue gathering by fixing paintings
and in the end, the player must use the clues to determine who destroyed the paintngs:
the friend, the professor, or the curator of the museum. We are going to make it
randomly pick at the beginning of each game so it can be any one of them for some
replayability. Right now, we are in the process of making the new games and hiring an artist,
and once we are finished with that, we are moving on to creating the new areas,
working on dialogue, and inserting clues into the game. I'm excited to watch this
game grow and continue development on it!
