Hello! It has been a while since my last blog post. After taking a mental health
break and then accidently forgetting to update the next week, I am back! Since
the last post, we have finished up the demo of the game. Right now it has two
chapters and showcases pretty much all of our plans besides storytelling and
choice-picking. A lot of UI updates were done including some better positioning
of objects, easier readability, and some small animations. We have contacted
Career Services and are awaiting a response so that we can meet with them and
discuss how to move forward with this project.
