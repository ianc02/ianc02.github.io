Disco Tray Studios is back after summer! We are picking up right where we left off
with working on Career Competencies, but with some additional tools and ideas. At
the beginning of August Dr. Goadrich, Jonathon, and I went to Madison, Wisconsin
to speak at the Play Make Learn event hosted at their university. It was an
incredible experience where we were able to learn a lot from people with a ton of
experience developing educational games. I am still sifting through all the notes
but once I get a more comprehensive list I can make a blog post dedicated to the visit.
For now, we will be working on Career Competencies up until the end of September
when the two-year version is going to be used in explorations classes around campus
so that we can get a ton of feedback and see how well students respond to this sort
of approach. From there, we will decide which way to best move forward, and potentially
start working on some other projects such as a game for the Windgate Museum.
