We finished up the first major push of Astronomical Bodies and Jonathon got it onto Disco Tray
Studios itch.io page! This will likely not be the last we work on this game, but the progress
we made was substantial and anything from here on out should be minor improvements. We are now
moving on to focus much more on the Chem-Sim game, which is a sort of educational sandbox game
that is supposed to teach users about enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Users are also
going to be able to insert molecules from a menu to have interact with one another in a higher
degree than what is currently available. Another major improvement is going to be making the
game more user friendly, both in terms of how the system works and visually, as there are
currently many clashing aspects that make it hard to focus. Our first major goal will be to
create a better system for molecule selection so that there can be little pictures of them along
with their name and values. There is not much to report on, progress wise, this week since we are
transitioning between games and we just had fall-break, but now that we are back in business
hopefully we can make lots of progress and won't have to rework an entire game system again.
