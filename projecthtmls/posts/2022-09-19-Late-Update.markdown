Disco Tray Studios is back after summer! We are picking up right where we left off
with working on Career Competencies, but with some additional tools and ideas. At
the beginning of August Dr. Goadrich, Jonathon, and I went to Madison, Wisconsin
to speak at the Play Make Learn event hosted at their university. It was an
incredible experience where we were able to learn a lot from people with a ton of
experience developing educational games. I am still sifting through all the notes
but once I get a more comprehensive list I can make a blog post dedicated to the visit.
For now, we will be working on Career Competencies up until the end of September
when the two-year version is going to be used in explorations classes around campus
so that we can get a ton of feedback and see how well students respond to this sort
of approach. From there, we will decide which way to best move forward, and potentially
start working on some other projects such as a game for the Windgate Museum.


So right after our first couple meetings, I ended up getting COVID and being out for two weeks.
This threw us off a bit as it made working together more difficult but we are finally getting
caught back up and although we are a tad behind, we are close to getting our demo out! As far
as updates go, Connor joined with us since he had Renpy experience. We have split the work
into three main sections, with Connor writing another scene for us and implementing it in.
Jonathon has been working to get our exhaustion system working and implemented throughout
the entire game, so that a player cannot just choose every 'good' option and easily get
the best ending easily. I have been working on our ending and creating pre=requisites
in order to get the job that the player wants.
    How this works is that on every map scene, if the player goes to Career Services
and asks for help on what to do next, they give the usual IRL advice, but then a
bonus scene pops up. Right now I have five of these implemented, but still need
another once Connor is done with his scene is pushes it. With these 5 current scenes,
the player has opportunities to gain two experience points in either STEM, Social
Sciences, or a more Business oriented path. At the end of the game, they must
choose between one of these paths for a potential job and if they have enough
qualifications, then they get in. Otherwise they don't. I have implemented all scenes but
if they get into a job. Once I do that I will be done with the ending entirely. There are
multiple ways to get a job, so that we still have the branching options.
    That is the largest change I have made. Other, smaller ones include changing values
for competencies so that changes are more noticeable, animating the difference so the
player can see how much they have lost or gained, and creating new expressions for other
characters.
    As I said earlier, we were supposed to have everything done by today for a demo we
could send Career Services. I am not quite ready for that unfortunately. I am going to
try and extend the deadline into tomorrow or Wednesday, so that I can finish the final
scene quickly and have time to polish everything and check for bugs or issues that
likely exist.
