This is my first official post on my site! I am still learning some 
basics of Jekyll and html so this will likely be a little boring looking for now. 

I am starting this as a part of the Disco Tray Studios that I was recently employed at,
but I also plan on using it for personal projects and ways to track my progress over time.
It will take me a bit before I can figure out how to like some of my projects to the site, 
so for now it will just be text blogs.

I am going to keep a lot of the default jekyll code on the site for now to use as
a reference as I learn how to fully utilize all the tools.
