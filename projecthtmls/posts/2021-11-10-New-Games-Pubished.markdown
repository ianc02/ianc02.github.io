This was a very good week for the GameDev team at Disco Tray Studios! We were
able to finish builds on both Chem-Sim and Climate Goes Political and get them
both published onto itch.io. Chem-Sim is in early stages right now as we have
not got any new molecules to add, but we did change up a lot of the user interface
as well as some of the behind the scenes aspects of the game. It is a busy time of
the year for everyone, so it is difficult to find times to work together with our
community partners for games, but we are able to get these preliminary visions
out so that they may give feedback on what we can do based off our meetings
early in the semester!

As for Climate Goes Political, there was not much more that Dr. Chomphosy wanted
from the game as he was very happy where it was, and anything else to make it a
level above would have been way out of our current scope without committing a
large amount of time towards learning about online play and complex equations
used in economics. Jonathon was able to get a lot of consistency throughout the
game and everything is running a bit more smoothly and looking a bit better!

At this point, I believe most of our focus is going to be going towards trying
to get @itsmaya completed or at least at a good level of completion that we can
have Dr. Veselka-Bush try it out and give a lot of feedback.
