The past couple weeks, Jonathon, Andrew, and I have been meeting up with past community partners
from CSCI-370 (Interactive Game Development) to get their feedback on the games that were
developed in partnership with them. From these meetings we got to understand better about what they
liked from the team that made them the game in the spring semester of 2021, what they would want changed,
and what their new or original goals were for the game.

We have decided we will start by working on Astronomical Bodies, Chem-Sim, and @itsmaya at first.
These games were developed for the physics, chemistry, and sociology departments, respectively.
Most of the work that I have put in has been into Astronomical bodies, which focuses on a simulation of
celestial bodies in a 2D plane in space, while allowing the user to manipulate data so that the game is
a sort of educational sandbox of a solar system. A lot of work has gone in to understanding the code
from the group who originally worked on it, and once I got a more stable footing I began work on a tutorial
for the game as many notes about the game asked for features that were present, but not necessarily intuitive.
I am mostly done with it, and plan on finishing it before our next Wednesday meeting on the 29th. After this, I
plan on working on figuring out an issue we found while looking through the code, which is that the values
used in the game are 'magic numbers' and are not real representations of what happens, which causes many
of the features that our partner, Dr. Ann Wright, impossible. We have two possible solutions that we will discuss more
in our meeting though.

I have also made a bit of progress in the Chem-Sim game, which focuses on users to create reactions by selecting
different molecules and being able to be quizzed on their enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy values. Most of
the work that I have put into it so far has been commenting code since I was a part of the original team in the spring.
I have not been working on @itsmaya, a decision based game that follows the life of Maya, a young black girl, as she
traverses through the public school system being indirectly impacted by players decisions as higher-ups in the school system.
