We had our first meeting at Disco Tray Studios! We got to know more about each
other and learn about everyone's strengths and what their focus will be in the team.
I will be doing a lot of work focused on the Game Dev part of the group, although
I am going to be learning more about front-end code so I can help out there too.
Right now the largest priorities for Game Dev is reaching out to get feedback from
last semesters community partners who worked with the Interactive
Game Development course, creating an itch.io page for Disco Tray Studios where
we can post the games that that class had made and that we will help refine, and
also working on my own site so it looks a lot better.
