After a discussion on what else we should include and what we should alter in
regards to @itsmaya, we have spent much of this week doing that. A lot of my
focus has been on aesthetics and flow, which are areas that I am usually not too
involved in. It has been a struggle this past week. The other day, after working
for around 2 hours my computer crashed and I lost all progress and couldn't work
until the next day. There is no easy way to do good looking borders on an image
in unity, so what I ended up doing is having to paint a border on a copy of the
policy images and then alternate the two images in game, which took me a while
because I have never really created any art for one of our games and it took me
several software to find a good one that was both intuitive and effective. I also
had some trouble with the game that Jonathon did not have on his end, so I had to
figure those issues out and fix them. Luckily, reordering the first chapter
was extremely easy and only took about a fifth of the time I thought it would! I
have learned a lot while working on this game, and I am going to miss the story
we were helping create, but after the struggle to get some things working I would
be lying if I said I was not also excited to move on and focus on something else
for a bit.
