We managed to finish and send out the second demo to career services! It took a bit
longer than expected, but we managed to get quite a bit into this new version and we
have already got feedback on it! I believe that the most notable changes are the added
story which includes most of Sophomore year, some distinct UI changes that have background
data controlling their view, and the tutorial. I did not manage to get quite as much
in story-wise, as we are still missing distinct parts of the end of Sophomore year,
with things like research opportunities and more dialogue, but I included in the demo
explanations of where everything goes and how it will interconnect to past decisions,
so that Career Services and their play-testers will understand where we are moving with
this. This week has been extremely difficult with trying to find time to work on the
game sadly, as finals are coming up and all my classes are doing their best to make
this week as busy as possible. I am going to try and work on this where possible,
but I know progress will be slower than usual this next week. My goal is that by my
last final, I want to get Sophomore year completely finished, and tie up any more loose
threads, along with implement more UI such as new backgrounds and more characters.
