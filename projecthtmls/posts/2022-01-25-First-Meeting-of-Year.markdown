We had our first meeting of the semester and year! It was nice to catch up and
double check where we are and what our future plans were. We are presenting our
rough draft for @itsmaya tomorrow so that the team can throw suggestions and
questions our way for us to work on before we upload to itch.io and schedule a
meeting with Dr. Veselka-Bush. A lot of what I have done is looking through the
sources we were given and giving an in-game explanation of why certain decisions
are or are not good and what impact they have on students. We have not updated
the entire game to match this, just the first half so we did not do a bunch of
unnecessary work in the event that Dr. Veselka-Bush wants to go in a different
direction.
I also sent messages out to our other partners that we have completed rough draft
games for, but they have not responded yet so I will try again tomorrow. Our next  
game to work will depend on what responses we get back, how early we can meet with
Dr. Veselka-Bush, and how busy Jonathon will be with the new websites Disco Tray
Studios is taking on.
Speaking of the new websites, we also got a new team member now that Vi has
graduated. Connor was in the database and web systems course, so he will be
working on the websites a lot. I believe these will be a major focus in the second
half of the semester as I think we are wanting to launch Good Vibes and slow down
the work on it.
I am excited to see what all we will accomplish this semester and am looking
forward to working on all these great projects!
