    from our demo, we got some really great feedback! Unfortunately, we also got
news that the structure of Career Services explorations class visits was changing,
which meant so had the direction of the game. Luckily, we were still able to use it
in Professor Seme's explorations class so we can still gather data from users. This
past week has mostly consisted of finishing up writing some of the smaller map scenes,
making the game feel more alive, and adding in some small ideas or plans suggested by
our playtesters. I believe that the class is playing the game on Thursday, so we should
have more responses to our questionnaire for next Monday's meeting. I am not sure
what the future of the game will look like after this though.
    In other news, the meeting for Mobile dev's community partners is tomorrow. We
will be figuring out what everyone want's from their app, and we are there to help
provide feedback and to keep things as realistic as possible. I know nothing about
mobile development so I'm sure it will be just as much of a learning experience for
me as it will be for them!
