Sadly we were not able to completely finish up the physics game last week, but we presented
in front of the group and they were able to give us a lot of ideas that are the focus point of this week.
There are only a couple of major things to do, such as including actual distance and highlighting selected planets.
Many of the new things we must work on are small, user interface things to just make the game feel a bit
better. Once we wrap this up, Chem-Sim is going to be our new focus with adding more reactions, creating
a more user friendly interface, and boosting up some potential style issues. Astronomical bodies has been
a much longer than expected project, but I believe it was still a good first choice since it showed us just how
much work some of these games may need, despite how they looked on the surface level. We thought
this game was almost done from the start but we ended up having to rework the entire gravity system. I hope
that this learning experience will allow us to complete these next games in a more timely manner.
