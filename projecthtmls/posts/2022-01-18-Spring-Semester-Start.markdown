Welcome back! This is my first post in a while since I have been taking a break
since the last one. After last semester and finals, I needed one. Jumping back
in though, I see a good future for us! Jonathon ended up doing some work throughout
winter break which was fun to catch back up on. I have done some work on @itsmaya
mostly fixing progression issues, beginning a layout for explanations of outcomes
to the users (although I am not sure if the current way it is set up will stay),
and starting to include our sources into the game itself. Progress has been slow,
a lot of which I will contribute to the confusing and almost maze-like backbone of
progression code that the original game was built upon. Another part is there are
several things I have noticed or wanted to bring up before implementing/changing
and luckily we have our first meeting of the spring semester tomorrow where I can
talk to Jonathon about them. Disco Tray Studios is getting more clients this semester,
but for websites instead of games. This will be exciting for the group, although I
know almost nothing about websites so I am sure I am going to either be learning a lot
in a short amount of time or I will be working more independently on the games.
