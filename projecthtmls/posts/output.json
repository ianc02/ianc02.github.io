    "contents": "The past couple weeks, Jonathon, Andrew, and I have been meeting up with past community partners\r\nfrom CSCI-370 (Interactive Game Development) to get their feedback on the games that were\r\ndeveloped in partnership with them. From these meetings we got to understand better about what they\r\nliked from the team that made them the game in the spring semester of 2021, what they would want changed,\r\nand what their new or original goals were for the game.\r\n\r\nWe have decided we will start by working on Astronomical Bodies, Chem-Sim, and @itsmaya at first.\r\nThese games were developed for the physics, chemistry, and sociology departments, respectively.\r\nMost of the work that I have put in has been into Astronomical bodies, which focuses on a simulation of\r\ncelestial bodies in a 2D plane in space, while allowing the user to manipulate data so that the game is\r\na sort of educational sandbox of a solar system. A lot of work has gone in to understanding the code\r\nfrom the group who originally worked on it, and once I got a more stable footing I began work on a tutorial\r\nfor the game as many notes about the game asked for features that were present, but not necessarily intuitive.\r\nI am mostly done with it, and plan on finishing it before our next Wednesday meeting on the 29th. After this, I\r\nplan on working on figuring out an issue we found while looking through the code, which is that the values\r\nused in the game are 'magic numbers' and are not real representations of what happens, which causes many\r\nof the features that our partner, Dr. Ann Wright, impossible. We have two possible solutions that we will discuss more\r\nin our meeting though.\r\n\r\nI have also made a bit of progress in the Chem-Sim game, which focuses on users to create reactions by selecting\r\ndifferent molecules and being able to be quizzed on their enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy values. Most of\r\nthe work that I have put into it so far has been commenting code since I was a part of the original team in the spring.\r\nI have not been working on @itsmaya, a decision based game that follows the life of Maya, a young black girl, as she\r\ntraverses through the public school system being indirectly impacted by players decisions as higher-ups in the school system.\r\n\n"

The majority of my\r\nwork has been focused on the tutorial of the game, including debugging and adding in new features,\r\nsuch as the in-time distance calculation between two bodies that Jonathon created. I have also had a large\r\nhand in implementing a new gravity system that uses Newtons gravitational interaction equation and the actual\r\nmasses of the planets. There are still sadly a few key features that we wanted to include that we have not\r\nbeen able to get yet, such as a real life value for distance or time it takes a body to orbit. One theory\r\nthat we have is that since we are using the right equation and masses, the distance is technically correct,\r\nsince the in-game time is real time. Essentially, the game has the bodies at a distance that, with those masses\r\nand times to orbit, is accurate. We have a few ways of going about solving this, such as having a distance modifier\r\nso that calculations are correct. Another plan is to have a logarithmic scaling model. Either way, we hope to\r\nfinish with this within the next couple days. Being able to display time to orbit for a body is\r\na problem that could have many complications. For example, do we do this on only planets, or stars as well?\r\nHow would this work in a binary system? How do we decide which bodies are orbiting what? This is something\r\nwe think we will have to talk to Dr. Wright about and come up with a plan together on what we should do,\r\nand in the mean time work on other projects. The plan is to work on Chem-Sim more, but we must get\r\ninto contact with Dr. Scott in order to get more reactions before much more work can be made on that, so\r\nwe may start on @itsmaya while we wait.\r\n\n"

We went over the itenerary and what sort of questions we\r\nwould be asking them. The next day we had our meeting and it went well. I spoke to\r\nProfessor Holly Payne, who wants a more streamlined website that is easier for her\r\nand her husband for their farm. I also spoke to Dr. Ann Wright about the website\r\nshe wants for promotion and information for an event she plans on throwing for\r\nthe solar eclipse in 2024.\r\n\r\nThe second thing we talked about were the itch.io account that we made for\r\nus to post games that we improve from last semesters Interactive Game Dev course,\r\nand the meetings that we have been setting up that will take place over the next\r\nweek with the community partners from that class to get feedback on what they\r\nthought of the games.\r\n\r\nThe last thing that was discussed was the Good Vibed app that is in development.\r\nWe were shown a demonstration on what the app does, as well as share ideas on\r\npossible tweaks to be made. We plan on having a demo available for Dr. Goadrich's\r\nTEC class by early october.\r\n\r\nOver the next week, I plan on playtesting the games made last semester so that\r\nI am better prepared for the meetings that we will be having. From those meetings\r\nand the critiques we get back, we will focus on getting the games to the what the\r\npartners want.\r\n\n"

Once we wrap this up, Chem-Sim is going to be our new focus with adding more reactions, creating\r\na more user friendly interface, and boosting up some potential style issues. Astronomical bodies has been\r\na much longer than expected project, but I believe it was still a good first choice since it showed us just how\r\nmuch work some of these games may need, despite how they looked on the surface level. We thought\r\nthis game was almost done from the start but we ended up having to rework the entire gravity system.

We are now\r\nmoving on to focus much more on the Chem-Sim game, which is a sort of educational sandbox game\r\nthat is supposed to teach users about enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. Users are also\r\ngoing to be able to insert molecules from a menu to have interact with one another in a higher\r\ndegree than what is currently available. Another major improvement is going to be making the\r\ngame more user friendly, both in terms of how the system works and visually, as there are\r\ncurrently many clashing aspects that make it hard to focus. Our first major goal will be to\r\ncreate a better system for molecule selection so that there can be little pictures of them along\r\nwith their name and values. There is not much to report on, progress wise, this week since we are\r\ntransitioning between games and we just had fall-break, but now that we are back in business\r\nhopefully we can make lots of progress and won't have to rework an entire game system again.\r\n\r\n[Here is the link for Astronomical Bodies!](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/astronomical-bodies)\r\n\n"

Currently all\r\nthe reactants are in a 4x3 grid with non-interactable rotating gameobject representations\r\nof the molecules for better clarity.

We talked about how to\r\nimplement the new 'Capital' system so that we could use the relationships of\r\ndifferent groups of people (Teachers, Faculty, Parents, Students, and Community)\r\nin order to be able to obtain new policies. The idea is that each decision will\r\nhave some numerical value associated to it for each group and the players relationship\r\nto those groups will be positively or negatively effected. Without a certain amount\r\nof support from certain groups, some things may not be possible as well. Our hope\r\nof switching from a monetary system to this capital system is that it becomes\r\nmore apparent that money is not necessarily the root of modern problems, but the\r\ndecisions and their effects themselves that led to the problems. This week we are\r\nworking on getting the new capital system into the game and being able to move\r\nthe game forward with this new system, and then next week we will likely work on\r\nchanging up more of the issues and policies to better match what we want.\r\n\r\nIn other news, Jonathon and I were able to sit in on a class with Dr. Chomphosy\r\nand his students as they played Climate Goes Political together in teams. It was\r\nvery interesting to see how they were a bit unsure of the game and what direction\r\nit would go in comparison to what they learned in class about game theory, but\r\nafter a first initial game to understand how the game works, they caught on fast\r\nand every team managed to significantly better and even start to communicate\r\namongst one another. It provided some valuable insight on how others would approach\r\nthis game and really helped us understand where we should take it in the next\r\nupdate with ideas of clarification, helpful progression pieces, and randomization.\r\n\n"

As far\r\nas updates go, Connor joined with us since he had Renpy experience. We have split the work\r\ninto three main sections, with Connor writing another scene for us and implementing it in.\r\nJonathon has been working to get our exhaustion system working and implemented throughout\r\nthe entire game, so that a player cannot just choose every 'good' option and easily get\r\nthe best ending easily. I have been working on our ending and creating pre=requisites\r\nin order to get the job that the player wants.\r\n    How this works is that on every map scene, if the player goes to Career Services\r\nand asks for help on what to do next, they give the usual IRL advice, but then a\r\nbonus scene pops up. Right now I have five of these implemented, but still need\r\nanother once Connor is done with his scene is pushes it. With these 5 current scenes,\r\nthe player has opportunities to gain two experience points in either STEM, Social\r\nSciences, or a more Business oriented path. At the end of the game, they must\r\nchoose between one of these paths for a potential job and if they have enough\r\nqualifications, then they get in. Otherwise they don't.

There are\r\nmultiple ways to get a job, so that we still have the branching options.\r\n    That is the largest change I have made. Other, smaller ones include changing values\r\nfor competencies so that changes are more noticeable, animating the difference so the\r\nplayer can see how much they have lost or gained, and creating new expressions for other\r\ncharacters.\r\n    As I said earlier, we were supposed to have everything done by today for a demo we\r\ncould send Career Services. I am not quite ready for that unfortunately. I am going to\r\ntry and extend the deadline into tomorrow or Wednesday, so that I can finish the final\r\nscene quickly and have time to polish everything and check for bugs or issues that\r\nlikely exist.\r\n\n"

It\r\ncan be very picky about certain things are used and it has been the case multiple\r\ntimes that I would get an idea to do something, scour the internet, and find a 'solution'\r\nthat is from outdated documentation and no longer works, and it does not give any hints\r\nas to what may be wrong. Due to this, most of my time has been to learning how to do\r\nmore specific tasks in Ren'py, and then debugging what I wrote. It is becoming\r\nmore natural to write in the language though, and I am finding myself not having to\r\nlook up things as often. I don't wish to jinx myself again, but I believe we are\r\nalmost finished with the demo. I have been able to separate our story sections out the way\r\nwe wanted with the map, added a section about career services, and included a way to keep track\r\nof the cultural competencies earned along the way. I believe the only thing to do\r\nleft is incorporate the remaining half of the first year story into the game.\r\n\n"

Now that we have wrapped that up though, and there is no\r\npressing deadline, we have been talking about what we will be working on in the future.\r\n  Our top three ideas right now are: working on the Windgate Museum art game that we\r\nhave been in talks with Lindsey Knight about; continuing work on @itsmaya and finding\r\na new client to take on the project, or begin looking into how we may host the GameJam\r\nwe were planning on doing next semester. After some conversation, I believe Connor\r\nwill be leaving the game dev group for now, and Jonathon and I are both very dialogued\r\nout so we were leaning more towards the art game. We set up a meeting with Lindsey and\r\nwill be recapping our original ideas and seeing where else this game may move towards,\r\nand this is happening Wednesday.

This is\r\na simpler approach to our original idea but I think it will work out well, especially\r\nwith Lindsey wanting these to be on the Ipads in the Museum. Speaking of, I have been\r\nable to play the puzzle game on my phone using Unity's remote testing app. It was\r\na bit slow, but I think that was mainly due to receiving input from the computer,\r\nchanging things on the phone, then sending data back to the computer. Hopefully\r\neverything happens in real time with the actual app. I have on more game to\r\ncode in before we start moving onto a larger focus of aesthetics.\r\n\n"

We did some\r\ngreat planning to map out how this semester would go and decided that our first\r\npriority would be to finish the analytics for Career Competencies and that is\r\nwhat we have been working on for the past several weeks. This has been a lot of\r\ntrial and error. Through the process we made some good discoveries like how to\r\nhave a browser version of the game work in itch.io or how to get analytics to\r\nsend to Google Analytics 4 (Yay!), but of course there have been horrible issues\r\nthat we are still stuck on now. Right now, analytics only works on downloaded\r\nversions of the game, not on web versions. This is due to an error \"SSL Support\r\nnot available\". One potential fix for this is to host a proxy server that would\r\naccept the requests from the game, and include SSL support before sending it\r\noff to GA4 but I have no idea how to go about doing that. Another issue is that\r\ngetting verification for downloadable versions of the game so that downloading\r\nthe game is easier is either expensive or a long process I still have not\r\nmanaged to get to the end of. Right now, the game does include analytics and can\r\nbe downloaded, though it would be nice to have everything be easier for the users.\r\n  After working on analytics, we'll be moving on to Tempest Winds again, potentially\r\nwith a mixup in whose working on it. Jonathon may move on to working on a couple\r\napps that came in from last semesters class, and Olivia and Matthew may start game dev\r\nagain. Our goal is to have the game fully finished by the end of the semester, which\r\nwill include about 3x the current number of games and a small story to connect the\r\ndifferent areas.\r\n\n"

This took a while\r\nto finally get down since instead of using a bunch of if-statements in order to\r\nknow what to display, I wanted to have entries in a list that we could loop through.\r\nAs I found out, for loops are not really supported in Ren.py, so it was a lot of trial\r\nand error. I did eventually figure out that they are supported when in reference to\r\na screen, so once I was able to get that worked out I was able to debug the issues,\r\nand now we have information displayed after the player checks their resume after\r\nevery chapter! I also included a section for Resume Tips, similar to the ones\r\nCareer Services provide in the real life Hendrix Today emails, along with a good vibe\r\nfrom the app at the end. Other than that, I cleaned a lot of stuff and made things\r\na lot more consistent and clean looking, as well as adding another area to the map.\r\nRight now, I am in the process of coding in the events displayed in Hendrix Today so\r\nthat we can have a fully functional demo of the first year for when we showcase our\r\ngame tomorrow to Career Services and get to hear their feedback! \r\n\n"

I've been focusing\r\nprimarily on mechanisms of gameplay, such as working on the games, making sure there\r\naren't any issues with them, the interactions with the world, randomization on who\r\ndid the crime and setting up clues for that. I've worked a bit on lighting and I\r\nthink its about as good as its going to get before we start adding shaders and/or\r\npost processing. Right now, the gameplay is almost complete. You can play and finish puzzles,\r\nand move on to the next level, but there is no story binding it all together. That \r\nis where a lot of my next focus is going to go into with character dialogue, art,\r\nand sound effects.

After walking them through the game we\r\ntalked for a while about minor adjustments and things to include, along with some\r\npotential story points to bring up. It was extremely helpful to hear their insight\r\nand get ideas about what else to include in the game. We were at a good point in the\r\ngame when we went to the meeting, foundation-wise, but now I think we've been set\r\nback a bit. This is in a good way though, as there are a lot of great new things I\r\nwould like to implement that would make the game a bit more intuitive and easier\r\non the players, so the structure of the game will likely have to shift a bit. I have\r\nso far started to incorporate some ideas, like including phone distribution builds\r\n(which is not going great, but that is why we start early!) and creating a tutorial\r\nfor the general concept of the game and how to navigate ren'py in a helpful manner.\r\nI am excited for our Wednesday meeting because there is a lot we have to talk about\r\nand discuss as a team on where we take our game and what our main focus is going to\r\nbe moving forward. As a dream goal, I wanted to get the game into a rough beta version\r\nwith all four years playable but after our meeting progressed and especially reflecting\r\non it after the fact with all the changes we are thinking of implementing, I believe\r\nat a minimum we are going to try and get a good version of the game with the first 2 years\r\nplayable before summer.\r\n\n"

We had a great discussion on the future of\r\nthe game and decided on expanding to three areas, with 4-5 games in each area. There is\r\nan overlying story as well, in which the player is an art restorationist who gets\r\na call from a friend about how someone broke into their apartment and ruined their\r\npaintings. The player goes there and fixes the paintings, collecting clues on\r\nthe person who destroyed the paintings. They then head to a local professors office\r\nwho had the same issue, and the player can gather more clues there. Finally, they head\r\nto the local art museum for one more round of clue gathering by fixing paintings\r\nand in the end, the player must use the clues to determine who destroyed the paintngs:\r\nthe friend, the professor, or the curator of the museum. We are going to make it\r\nrandomly pick at the beginning of each game so it can be any one of them for some\r\nreplayability. Right now, we are in the process of making the new games and hiring an artist,\r\nand once we are finished with that, we are moving on to creating the new areas,\r\nworking on dialogue, and inserting clues into the game.

I did not manage to get quite as much\r\nin story-wise, as we are still missing distinct parts of the end of Sophomore year,\r\nwith things like research opportunities and more dialogue, but I included in the demo\r\nexplanations of where everything goes and how it will interconnect to past decisions,\r\nso that Career Services and their play-testers will understand where we are moving with\r\nthis.
