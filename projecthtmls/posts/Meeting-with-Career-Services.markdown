Last Thursday we had our meeting with career services over the progress we had
made on the game so far, and it went really well! They were a huge fan of the assets,
the current story, and gameplay as a whole. After walking them through the game we
talked for a while about minor adjustments and things to include, along with some
potential story points to bring up. It was extremely helpful to hear their insight
and get ideas about what else to include in the game. We were at a good point in the
game when we went to the meeting, foundation-wise, but now I think we've been set
back a bit. This is in a good way though, as there are a lot of great new things I
would like to implement that would make the game a bit more intuitive and easier
on the players, so the structure of the game will likely have to shift a bit. I have
so far started to incorporate some ideas, like including phone distribution builds
(which is not going great, but that is why we start early!) and creating a tutorial
for the general concept of the game and how to navigate ren'py in a helpful manner.
I am excited for our Wednesday meeting because there is a lot we have to talk about
and discuss as a team on where we take our game and what our main focus is going to
be moving forward. As a dream goal, I wanted to get the game into a rough beta version
with all four years playable but after our meeting progressed and especially reflecting
on it after the fact with all the changes we are thinking of implementing, I believe
at a minimum we are going to try and get a good version of the game with the first 2 years
playable before summer.
