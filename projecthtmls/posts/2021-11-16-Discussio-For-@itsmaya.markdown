Since we published both Chem-Sim and Climate Goes Political on itch.io, on Wednesday
we discussed what our plan was going to be for @itsmaya. We talked about how to
implement the new 'Capital' system so that we could use the relationships of
different groups of people (Teachers, Faculty, Parents, Students, and Community)
in order to be able to obtain new policies. The idea is that each decision will
have some numerical value associated to it for each group and the players relationship
to those groups will be positively or negatively effected. Without a certain amount
of support from certain groups, some things may not be possible as well. Our hope
of switching from a monetary system to this capital system is that it becomes
more apparent that money is not necessarily the root of modern problems, but the
decisions and their effects themselves that led to the problems. This week we are
working on getting the new capital system into the game and being able to move
the game forward with this new system, and then next week we will likely work on
changing up more of the issues and policies to better match what we want.

In other news, Jonathon and I were able to sit in on a class with Dr. Chomphosy
and his students as they played Climate Goes Political together in teams. It was
very interesting to see how they were a bit unsure of the game and what direction
it would go in comparison to what they learned in class about game theory, but
after a first initial game to understand how the game works, they caught on fast
and every team managed to significantly better and even start to communicate
amongst one another. It provided some valuable insight on how others would approach
this game and really helped us understand where we should take it in the next
update with ideas of clarification, helpful progression pieces, and randomization.
