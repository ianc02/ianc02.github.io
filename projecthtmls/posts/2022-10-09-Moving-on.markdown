  We are officially done with the demo of Career Competencies! Our final push went
out the other day and on Thursday, we had Professor Seme's explorations class play it.
I, unfortunately, could not be there but from what I have read in the responses it
seems like it went well, although I am sure I will get the full rundown of how it
went on Monday's meeting. Now that we have wrapped that up though, and there is no
pressing deadline, we have been talking about what we will be working on in the future.
  Our top three ideas right now are: working on the Windgate Museum art game that we
have been in talks with Lindsey Knight about; continuing work on @itsmaya and finding
a new client to take on the project, or begin looking into how we may host the GameJam
we were planning on doing next semester. After some conversation, I believe Connor
will be leaving the game dev group for now, and Jonathon and I are both very dialogued
out so we were leaning more towards the art game. We set up a meeting with Lindsey and
will be recapping our original ideas and seeing where else this game may move towards,
and this is happening Wednesday. Right now we are in a bit of a limbo of not much
work to do, but I am excited to see what comes out of this.
