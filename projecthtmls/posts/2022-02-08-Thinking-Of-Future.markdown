@itsmaya has been officially published to itch.io! It is looking great and it
makes me so happy to finally see it up there. Now that we have finished with that
for now, we started discussing about what our next moves will be. We talked about
whether to continue on with either Art-tastrophe or the Career Services game. I
don't believe we made a concrete decision yet, but we are getting prepared for
either direction. I sent a message to the Director of the Windgate Museum of Art,
Mary Kennedy, to ask about her ideas on the game and to set up a meeting time. I
have not got a response back yet, but I am hopeful that we will continue work on it.

For Career Services, Dr. Goadrich introduced us to an awesome Python engine for
creating interactive narratives called Ren'py, which has been used to make games
like Doki Doki Literature Club and A Letter of Challenge. I have been watching
introductory videos in order to learn the system and get used to it, and am
already amazed with how much progress I made in a short amount of time. The
pre-built menu system saved a ton of time, and not having to mess with a canvas
in Unity takes a lot of manual work away. I can already easily make dialogue,
change backgrounds, create alternate endings, and perform a bunch of small
customizations that help make the game feel a bit more natural. At this point, I
think that creating some UI elements such as characters or specific backgrounds
will be the most challenging part, as user interaction seems pretty intuitive and
I believe Ren'py allows a lot more than simple click boxes, with a bit of manipulation.
I am excited to try something new, and branch out a bit further in game development
than just Unity!
