This week, like last, has been painfully slow and also difficult to find time for.
I have been incredibly busy with school, and also my computer has been having issues
left and right and has been incredibly slow, so progress has not been as much as
I had wanted. It has been a bit better so, although I wanted to get a second demo
to Career Services today and I don't think that will happen, we are close and should
be able to get it tomorrow. So far, I have done a lot of structural changes in the
game to make it more like the end product and have included several new features
like a small character creator where the player can enter in some necessary information
for the game to know what to display sometimes, background variables to keep track
of competency values and a displayable that shows up on the resume to show that progress
to the player, added a tutorial, and added in the a scene from the year 2 storyline.
Right now, most of what we need to still complete for a demo is to include more
of the story, mostly for the second year, and add a bit more to the first year
so it feels more fleshed out.
