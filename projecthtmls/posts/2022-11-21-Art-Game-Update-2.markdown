  I apologize for the late update, but we have been hard at work and are wrapping
up our initial demo. We have five working games now, with the player being able to
choose what game they would like to play. We are trying to figure out how to make
an app out of it and while we have it built for IOS, I think our initial plan
is to have it as a testflight app. We are trying to get in touch with Lindsey Knight
so she can approve our demo and see if we want to take it any further.
  In other news, Career Services wants to use their game again for career fair for
sophomores in January. This will have around 130 new players so we are very excited
for that, although there are a few changes we are going to have to make before it is
ready to go. Nothing major, just some quick tweaks to help some common sources of
confusion.
