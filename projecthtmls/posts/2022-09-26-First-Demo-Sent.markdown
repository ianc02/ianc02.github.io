    We were able to push back out deadline to Wednesday, luckily. Connor, Jonathon, and
I all finished our goals and were able to publish the game for a demo. All the members
of Disco Tray Studios played it and sent out a form for us with questions and comments.
It was fun to watch their directions and helped us understand how we should better balance
our values. Unfortunately, there were a lot of times that the game seemed to crash.
I believe most of the issues were minor bugs that we fixed in a few minutes before we
uploaded a more stable version. We sent it to Career Services and they and their
student workers have tried it. During our meeting today we are going discuss what
people thought of the game, what issues need to be tackled, and when we are going
to meet with Career Services so that we can better discuss what needs to be done.
This is our last week working on it before it needs to be completely finished for our
two year demo to send out to the explorations classes.
