During this weekly meeting, we discussed our current three largest projects,
what progress we have made on them, and what progress we hope to make this week.

First, we discussed the meeting we had planned the next day with the community
partners for CSCI 340. We went over the itenerary and what sort of questions we
would be asking them. The next day we had our meeting and it went well. I spoke to
Professor Holly Payne, who wants a more streamlined website that is easier for her
and her husband for their farm. I also spoke to Dr. Ann Wright about the website
she wants for promotion and information for an event she plans on throwing for
the solar eclipse in 2024.

The second thing we talked about were the itch.io account that we made for
us to post games that we improve from last semesters Interactive Game Dev course,
and the meetings that we have been setting up that will take place over the next
week with the community partners from that class to get feedback on what they
thought of the games.

The last thing that was discussed was the Good Vibed app that is in development.
We were shown a demonstration on what the app does, as well as share ideas on
possible tweaks to be made. We plan on having a demo available for Dr. Goadrich's
TEC class by early october.

Over the next week, I plan on playtesting the games made last semester so that
I am better prepared for the meetings that we will be having. From those meetings
and the critiques we get back, we will focus on getting the games to the what the
partners want.
