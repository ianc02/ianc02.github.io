After spring break, we are jumping back in where we left off! I have been working
on our 'Hendrix Today' cutscene in the game so that players will be aware of events
going on at different locations of the campus at different points. This took a while
to finally get down since instead of using a bunch of if-statements in order to
know what to display, I wanted to have entries in a list that we could loop through.
As I found out, for loops are not really supported in Ren.py, so it was a lot of trial
and error. I did eventually figure out that they are supported when in reference to
a screen, so once I was able to get that worked out I was able to debug the issues,
and now we have information displayed after the player checks their resume after
every chapter! I also included a section for Resume Tips, similar to the ones
Career Services provide in the real life Hendrix Today emails, along with a good vibe
from the app at the end. Other than that, I cleaned a lot of stuff and made things
a lot more consistent and clean looking, as well as adding another area to the map.
Right now, I am in the process of coding in the events displayed in Hendrix Today so
that we can have a fully functional demo of the first year for when we showcase our
game tomorrow to Career Services and get to hear their feedback!
