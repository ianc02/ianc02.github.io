This past week, I have been working a lot on the Astronomical Bodies game. The majority of my
work has been focused on the tutorial of the game, including debugging and adding in new features,
such as the in-time distance calculation between two bodies that Jonathon created. I have also had a large
hand in implementing a new gravity system that uses Newtons gravitational interaction equation and the actual
masses of the planets. There are still sadly a few key features that we wanted to include that we have not
been able to get yet, such as a real life value for distance or time it takes a body to orbit. One theory
that we have is that since we are using the right equation and masses, the distance is technically correct,
since the in-game time is real time. Essentially, the game has the bodies at a distance that, with those masses
and times to orbit, is accurate. We have a few ways of going about solving this, such as having a distance modifier
so that calculations are correct. Another plan is to have a logarithmic scaling model. Either way, we hope to
finish with this within the next couple days. Being able to display time to orbit for a body is
a problem that could have many complications. For example, do we do this on only planets, or stars as well?
How would this work in a binary system? How do we decide which bodies are orbiting what? This is something
we think we will have to talk to Dr. Wright about and come up with a plan together on what we should do,
and in the mean time work on other projects. The plan is to work on Chem-Sim more, but we must get
into contact with Dr. Scott in order to get more reactions before much more work can be made on that, so
we may start on @itsmaya while we wait.
