For the past week and a half, we have been putting a lot of our efforts into Chem-Sim.
Jonathon has been doing a lot of fixing graphical issues and making the game look a
lot nicer, while most of my focus has been going towards creating a new table for
selecting reactants instead of the scroll wheel that existed first. We were able to
speed up this process considerably by reusing the drag and drop cells from Astronomical
Bodies, although I did have to tweak it a bit to better work for our case. Currently all
the reactants are in a 4x3 grid with non-interactable rotating gameobject representations
of the molecules for better clarity. Our plan is to have even more reactions possible with
the reactants we have now, and with more that we are supposed to get from our partner,
Dr. Scott. This game seems to be moving a lot quicker than Astronomical Bodies, which is
great news, although I do definitely see this game being one we go back to a lot to keep
adding new molecules and updating features after publishing. I think a good goal for us is
to get it uploaded onto itch.io by next Wednesday and be on our next game at that point.
