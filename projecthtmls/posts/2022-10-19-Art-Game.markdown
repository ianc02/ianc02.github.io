  We have decided to work on the Windgate's game. We set up an initial meeting with 
Lindsey Knight, and have got some beginning ideas we are still throwing around, along
with an initial game with a moveable character. I have not done much more work on
this game, as we had fall break and then I missed the two days after for a wedding.
During today's meeting, I expect I'll get caught up with what Jonathon has been working on
and we'll discuss our ideas along with Lindsey's input.
