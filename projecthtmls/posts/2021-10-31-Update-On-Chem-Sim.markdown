We have made a lot of progress on Chem-Sim and are already getting to a good point
to publish a first version onto our itch.io page. We decided to make a lot of visual
changes over this week such as changing the layout of everything to make it more
spacious and have things less spread out. We have also been working on conciseness
between scenes, molecules, and visual things such as button colors and shape.
Over the past week, I have been mostly working on getting the our new reactants
table to work in the tutorial and on making the molecules look just a bit better.
I believe Jonathon has been using this week to transition onto future projects such
as Climate Goes Political and @itsmaya in order to get a larger head start so that
we can get both of those published and have good progress on our last two games
before the semester is over. We are going to use this upcoming Wednesday to showcase
our progress on Chem-Sim to get any last minute critiques and suggestions before we
upload and move on.
