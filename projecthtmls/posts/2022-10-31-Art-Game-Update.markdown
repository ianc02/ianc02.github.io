  We have been hard at work with the game. Right now, our focus is on 'repairing'
the artwork after someone has come in and sabotaged the pieces. This is done in
several ways, like jigsaw puzzles, tile slides, ISpy, and other game types. This is
a simpler approach to our original idea but I think it will work out well, especially
with Lindsey wanting these to be on the Ipads in the Museum. Speaking of, I have been
able to play the puzzle game on my phone using Unity's remote testing app. It was
a bit slow, but I think that was mainly due to receiving input from the computer,
changing things on the phone, then sending data back to the computer. Hopefully
everything happens in real time with the actual app. I have on more game to
code in before we start moving onto a larger focus of aesthetics.
