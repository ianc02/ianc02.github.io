                            <b>It Waves</b>
                            <p>
                                I've started developing another game, current working title <i>It Waves</i>. It is also heavily inspired by <i>Outer Wilds</i> in the sense of it will be a 
                                knowledged based game. These are games where instead of needing keys to unlock doors or a special tool to access a new part of a dungeon, the only thing holding 
                                back a players progression is their own ignorance of the world, and they find through exploration, trial and error, or even by random, the rules of that games 
                                universe and how to navigate it. I love the way <i>Outer Wilds</i> allows for this by utilizing a time loop, so that there aren't any real consequences to trying stuff out.
                                The worst thing that could happen is a player just has to try again. I wanted to do a similar thing, but not with time loops. <i>It Waves</i> uses a dual star system instead to 
                                create cyclic events. As the two suns rotate, they change both the lighting as well as the gravity and temperature of the planet, allowing for more complicated jumps or freezing and thawing water. Since 
                                the two suns move at different rates, the full "cycle" really takes four orbits of the slower sun. The story of the game is still being worked on, but the premise is inspired by 
                                <i>Solaris</i> by Stanislaw Lem. The player is researching the ruins of an ancient civilization and uncovers their history and why they disappeared. Throughout playing the game, 
                                the player learns that the ocean on the planet is intelligent and has been able to keep the planet in stable orbit around the two suns. The ancient civilization was able 
                                to communicate with the ocean and it played some role in their disappearance. I intend on creating a new section of the website for blog updates on this game, as well as a better 
                                overview.

                            <p>
                                This is a new game I've been working on in my spare time. I'm honestly still not sure where it will end up but 
                                there are a few ideas that I've been juggling around. This game came from the desire to make a game with a horror element. It's something Jonathon and I had joked about 
                                for a while but I always loved games that have an unexpected unnerving presence (think <i>Majoras Mask</i>, <i>Firewatch</i>, and <i>Outer Wilds</i>). None of 
                                these games are horror at their core, but they all have some of the best horror sequences I've ever played and I think that having those elements makes the game 
                                as a whole more fun.

                            <p>
                                I started dabbling in website hacking with my brother. We've only really gotten into the basics so far like cross-site scripting (XSS) and 
                                Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) for example while also learning some useful tools and resources like BurpSuite and PicoCTF. It is a lot different from anything 
                                I am used to, so there has been a bit of a learning curve.
