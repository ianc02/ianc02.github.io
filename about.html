                    I grew up in Northwest Arkansas. I moved around a bit until settling into Pea Ridge in middle school. I graduated high school from there 
                    and met the love of my life, Madison. We did long distance during college; She went to Belhaven University in Jackson, Mississippi while I then went to 
                    Hendrix College with my two best friends, Connor and Cooper, where I majored in Computer Science and BCMB (Biochemistry/Microbiology).
                    I made a ton of friends there and had a great time learning more about the world. We all graduated in May of 2023 and not long after Madison and I moved North. 
                    Now I am living in Middleton, Wisconsin where she is completing her doctorate in organic chemistry at UW Madison. We love it up here, although the winters are still daunting. 
                    I've learned to appreciate the summer and outdoors a lot more, I've gotten into biking and kayaking. Madison and I also love to walk around the local trails and play pickleball.

                    I'm currently working as a Scientist I
                    at PPD ThermoFisher here in Middleton, WI where I perform lab testing for verification of products and 
                    documentation of said tests. I started in August of 2023 and have been learning a lot in that side of the pharmaceutical industry! It's also been a great experience to work a full time job and 
                    see the differences between that lifestyle and one of being a student. I'm learning some great skills and habits there as I plan the future of my career as an aspiring software developer.
